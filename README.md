Laptop Shrimping - Somewhere between Pimping, Skimping and Scrimping

This repository provides example code and updates in support of a Safari Books blog, describing how to 
Shrimp a Laptop with Lubuntu and RGB Led Strips with the smallest possible bill of materials.

The Arduino library for driving HL1606 RGB strips is included in this repository for simplicity, but is originally available in Adafruit's 
github repository where updates may be available.
